# Testing my skills in vanilla JavaScript, Sass, jQuery and HTML5 with TicTacToe


This is my version of TicTacToe developed using pure HTML, Sass, vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

Just got the basics of jQuery and I made this. It's a little bit...as such, I need to improve my code and try coming up with a better (clean and dry) code.

### Note:
This program doesn't follow certain JavaScript best practices as such. I am fully aware of certain corrections to be made and I plan on making them with further commits. I also welcome feedbacks, as I believe this will help me improve and become a better developer.
